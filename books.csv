67,Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the bestselling author of The Black Swan and one of the foremost thinkers of our time, reveals how to thrive in an uncertain world.  Just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension, and rumors or riots intensify when someone tries to repress them, many things in life benefit from stress, disorder, volatility, and turmoil. What Taleb has identified and calls â€œantifragileâ€ù is that category of things that not only gain from chaos but need it in order to survive and flourish.  In The Black Swan, Taleb showed us that highly improbable and unpredictable events underlie almost everything about our world. In Antifragile, Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, even necessary, and proposes that things be built in an antifragile manner. The antifragile is beyond the resilient or robust. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better.  Furthermore, the antifragile is immune to prediction errors and protected from adverse events. Why is the city-state better than the nation-state, why is debt bad for you, and why is what we call â€œefficientâ€ù not efficient at all? Why do government responses and social policies protect the strong and hurt the weak? Why should you write your resignation letter before even starting on the job? How did the sinking of the Titanic save lives? The book spans innovation by trial and error, life decisions, politics, urban planning, war, personal finance, economic systems, and medicine. And throughout, in addition to the street wisdom of Fat Tony of Brooklyn, the voices and recipes of ancient wisdom, from Roman, Greek, Semitic, and medieval sources, are loud and clear.  Antifragile is a blueprint for living in a Black Swan world.", Phenomenology,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yKG1SbjsL._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"
70,"Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future", Peter Thiel,"If you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets.  The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things.  Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if weâ€™re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.  Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin wonâ€™t make a search engine. Tomorrowâ€™s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in todayâ€™s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.  Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.",Business & Money,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41PZRSHF-NL.jpg

73,Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike,Phil Knight  James,"In this candid and riveting memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and board chairman Phil Knight shares the inside story of the companyâ€™s early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the worldâ€™s most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands.  Young, searching, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed fifty dollars from his father and launched a company with one simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost running shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed eight thousand dollars that first year, 1963. Today, Nikeâ€™s annual sales top $30 billion. In this age of start-ups, Knightâ€™s Nike is the gold standard, and its swoosh is more than a logo. A symbol of grace and greatness, itâ€™s one of the few icons instantly recognized in every corner of the world.  But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always been a mystery. Now, in a memoir thatâ€™s surprising, humble, unfiltered, funny, and beautifully crafted, he tells his story at last. It all begins with a classic crossroads moment. Twenty-four years old, backpacking through Asia and Europe and Africa, wrestling with lifeâ€™s Great Questions, Knight decides the unconventional path is the only one for him. Rather than work for a big corporation, he will create something all his own, something new, dynamic, different. Knight details the many terrifying risks he encountered along the way, the crushing setbacks, the ruthless competitors, the countless doubters and haters and hostile bankersâ€”as well as his many thrilling triumphs and narrow escapes. Above all, he recalls the foundational relationships that formed the heart and soul of Nike, with his former track coach, the irascible and charismatic Bill Bowerman, and with his first employees, a ragtag group of misfits and savants who quickly became a band of swoosh-crazed brothers.  Together, harnessing the electrifying power of a bold vision and a shared belief in the redemptive, transformative power of sports, they created a brand, and a culture, that changed everything.", Business,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sUlL5maVL.jpg
74,Outliers: The Story of Success ,Malcolm Gladwell ,"In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of ""outliers""--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?  His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.  Brilliant and entertaining, Outliers is a landmark work that will simultaneously delight and illuminate.", Social Psychology & Interactions,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41h5QL0vVEL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"

In 2014, Alibabaâ€™s $25 billion IPO was the largest global IPO in history.
